# Employee Performance Analysis: Experience, Training & Recognition

## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee performance using organizational experience, training exposure, and recognition data to identify patterns influencing workforce effectiveness. The objective is to derive data-driven insights and translate them into actionable HR recommendations that support sustainable performance optimization.

**Business Question:**  
What combination of experience, training exposure, and recognition mechanisms most strongly influences employee performance outcomes?

---

## Objectives

* Examine the relationship between employee experience and performance outcomes
* Evaluate the effectiveness of training programs and identify diminishing returns
* Assess alignment between performance-based recognition and measurable outcomes
* Provide evidence-backed recommendations for HR strategy and workforce development

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized employee-level information, including:

* Demographics (age, gender, education)
* Organizational experience (length of service, tenure)
* Training metrics (number of trainings, training scores)
* Performance indicators (KPIs, ratings, awards)

Data quality checks and preprocessing steps were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

---

## Key Metrics

* KPI achievement rate
* Average training score
* Training frequency per employee
* Experience–performance relationship
* Recognition incidence among high performers

---

## Project Structure & Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   * Handling missing values
   * Correcting invalid or inconsistent entries
   * Feature validation and logical constraints

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   * Univariate and bivariate analysis
   * Distribution and trend analysis
   * Cross-factor and correlation assessment

3. **Insight Generation**
   * Identification of key performance drivers
   * Analysis of interactions between experience, training, and recognition

4. **Business Translation**
   * Insights consolidated in `insights.md`
   * Actionable HR strategies outlined in `recommendations.md`

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to complement the Python-based analysis and enable intuitive exploration of insights.

### Dashboard Highlights
* Workforce composition overview (age, tenure, department)
* Experience vs performance analysis
* Training effectiveness and diminishing returns visualization
* Recognition impact on KPI achievement and performance ratings

The dashboard is designed with consistent visual encoding, uniform sizing, and minimal clutter to ensure business readability and executive-level interpretation.

## Key Takeaway

Employee performance is not driven by a single factor, but by the interaction between experience accumulation, training quality, and performance-aligned recognition. Organizations that optimize training effectiveness and align rewards with measurable outcomes are better positioned to achieve sustainable workforce performance.
